1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

**LINE**

1. The data is structured as an array. It allows to search for the first, last, and middle items, and to add or removes items
2. Data can be retrieved using the name of the person as the parameter of the search method
3. Any type of real-world ordered list such as waiting lists or playlists

**SCREEN**

1. The data is structured as an array of arrays. Data can be accessed by 'classic' array manipulation
2. To find a specific element (pixel) in the matrix (array of arrays), you use x & y properties of the pixel as indexes of the matrix
3. A representation of a mathematical function, a chess board, or any real-world application requiring x & y coordinates
